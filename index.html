                <h2>Mridula Thulasiraman</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Mridula Thulasiraman, and I am a computer science major at Virginia Polytechnic Institute with a passion for cybersecurity. I have experience in web scraping and analyzing data using Python, as well as customer service skills from my retail associate position at Smithsonian Enterprises. In addition to my studies and work experience, I have participated in various cybersecurity activities and projects, such as the AFA CyberPatriot competition and the Radford RUSecure CTF. I also helped lead a Capture the Flag (CTF) workshop for beginner-level students at the Academies of Loudoun Hackathon. My skills include troubleshooting basic computer hardware and software issues, working with operating systems like Windows and MacOS, and basic Python programming. I also have a good understanding of cloud computing concepts, as well as security policies and procedures. I am certified in CompTIA A+. I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity, and am open to opportunities to contribute to projects and teams in this field. Thank you for considering my portfolio.</p>
