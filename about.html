        <p>I’m Mriudla Thulasiraman, a passionate and driven individual with a deep commitment to cybersecurity. As an active member of the VT Cybersecurity Club, I thrive on exploring the latest security challenges and collaborating with like-minded peers to stay ahead of emerging threats. My enthusiasm for problem-solving extends beyond cybersecurity; I’m also an avid math enthusiast, actively participating in the VT GRE/MSG Club, where I sharpen my analytical skills and prepare for future academic pursuits.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my academic interests, I’m involved in the VT Wind Turbine Club, where I contribute to innovative projects that harness renewable energy, combining my love for technology with environmental sustainability.</p>

        <p>Currently, I’m working on a personal project, <strong>Emails2Calendar</strong>. This application is designed to streamline and automate my schedule management by scanning multiple email accounts for due dates, appointments, and events, and then seamlessly adding them to my personal calendar. The project integrates multiple email providers like Gmail and Outlook, uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract key details, and syncs them with my calendar. While still in the research phase, I’m utilizing various Python libraries and APIs, such as the Gmail API, Microsoft Graph API, and Google Cloud’s Natural Language API, to bring this vision to life.</p>

        <p>As I continue to develop my technical skills, I’m also preparing for the Security+ exam, which I plan to take in December, further solidifying my knowledge in the cybersecurity field.</p>
